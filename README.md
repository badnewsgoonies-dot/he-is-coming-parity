# He Is Coming Parity Build

This repository is the working codebase for a full-parity replication effort.

Goals:
- Implement the deterministic core systems (combat, timeline, triggers).
- Build data-driven content pipelines (items, enemies, regions).
- Reach mode parity (Kingmaker + Friend Battle).
- Track parity gaps with automated tests and a scoreboard.

Status: initialized.
